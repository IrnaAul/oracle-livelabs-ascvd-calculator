# Oracle LiveLabs Workshop: Building an ASCVD Risk Calculator

## Introduction
This repository tracks my progress through the Oracle LiveLabs Workshop on building an ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) Risk Calculator. The application is developed using Oracle Application Express (APEX) and FHIR APIs.

### Workshop Objectives:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of ASCVD risk assessment and tools used (APEX, FHIR APIs).
2. **APEX Application Setup**: Creating an APEX workspace and setting up the application.
3. **Signing up for Code Console**: Registering with Code Console to use Oracle's FHIR APIs.
4. **Creating ASCVD Risk Calculator**: Designing the interface, implementing logic, and customizing the calculator.
